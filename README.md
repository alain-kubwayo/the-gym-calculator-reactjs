# Calculator App

This project was built as part of series of React exercises given by [The Gym](https://www.thegym-rwanda.com/). 
## Instructions

Create an app that performs basic calculator functionality using React as shown in the screenshot below. The calculator app should be designed using tailwindcss.

The video below shows that the app should work so that if you choose the operation, the numbers you entered before will disappear. 

For example, if you enter 2 + 3 instead of choosing the equal sign operator you choose another operator the app should show first the result of the first operation and proceed to the next. (it is also shown in the video)

The app should work in a similar manner as shown in the video.

## Technologies
* ReactJS
* TailwindCSS

## Run Project Locally
First, ensure you have node (node v16+ and npm installed)

* `git clone https://github.com/alain-kubwayo/the-gym-calculator-reactjs.git`
* `cd the-gym-calculator-reactjs`
* `npm install`
* `npm run start`

The last command spins up the local development server on port 3000 by default.
